CRONTAB SYNTAX & USAGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(from "man crontab(5)")
Commands are executed by cron(8) when the minute, hour,	and  month  of
       year  fields  match  the current time, and when at least one of the two
       day fields (day of month, or day of week) match the current  time  (see
       ``Note'' below).  cron(8) examines cron entries once every minute.  The
       time and date fields are:

	      field	     allowed values
	      -----	     --------------
	      minute	     0-59
	      hour	     0-23
	      day of month   1-31
	      month	     1-12 (or names, see below)
	      day of week    0-7 (0 or 7 is Sun, or use names)

       A field may be an asterisk (*), which always stands for ``first-last''.

       Ranges of numbers are allowed.  Ranges are two numbers separated with a
       hyphen.	The specified range is inclusive.  For example,  8-11  for  an
       ``hours'' entry specifies execution at hours 8, 9, 10 and 11.

       Lists are allowed.  A list is a set of numbers (or ranges) separated by
       commas.	Examples: ``1,2,5,9'', ``0-4,8-12''.

       Step values can be used in conjunction with ranges.  Following a  range
       with  ``/<number>''  specifies  skips of the number's value through the
       range.  For example, ``0-23/2'' can be used in the hours field to spec-
       ify command execution every other hour (the alternative in the V7 stan-
       dard is ``0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22'').  Steps are also  permitted
       after  an asterisk, so if you want to say ``every two hours'', just use
       ``*/2''.

       Names can also be used for the ``month'' and ``day  of  week''  fields.
       Use  the  first	three  letters	of  the  particular day or month (case
       doesn't matter).  Ranges or lists of names are not allowed.

       The ``sixth'' field (the rest of the line) specifies the command to  be
       run.   The  entire  command  portion  of the line, up to a newline or %
       character, will be executed by /bin/sh or by the shell specified in the
       SHELL  variable of the crontab file.  Percent-signs (%) in the command,
       unless escaped with backslash (\), will be changed into newline charac-
       ters,  and  all	data  after the first % will be sent to the command as
       standard input. There is no way to split a  single  command  line  onto
       multiple lines, ala the shell's trailing "\".

       Note:  The  day of a command's execution can be specified by two fields
       -- day of month, and day of week.  If both fields are restricted (i.e.,
       aren't  *),  the command will be run when either field matches the cur-
       rent time.  For example,
       ``30 4 1,15 * 5'' would cause a command to be run at 4:30 am on the 1st
       and 15th of each month, plus every Friday.
