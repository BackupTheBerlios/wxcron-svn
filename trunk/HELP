SYNTAX & USAGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Commands are executed by wxCron when the minute, hour and  month  of year
fields match the current time, and when at least one of the two day fields
(day of month, or day of week) match the current time (see 'Note' below).

The time and date fields are:

  field	     	allowed values
  -----	     	--------------
  minute	 	0-59
  hour	     	0-23
  day of month  1-31
  month	     	1-12
  day of week   0-7 (0 or 7 is Sun)

A field may be an asterisk (*), which always stands for 'first-last'.

Ranges of numbers are allowed. Ranges are two numbers separated with a hyphen.
The specified range is inclusive. For example, 8-11 for an 'hours' entry
specifies execution at hours 8, 9, 10 and 11.

Lists are allowed. A list is a set of numbers (or ranges) separated by commas.
Examples: '1,2,5,9', '0-4,8-12'

Step values can be used in conjunction with ranges. Following a range with
'/<number>' specifies skips of the number's value through the range.
For example, '0-23/2' for an 'hours' field entry specifies execution every at
hours from 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22. Steps are also permitted
after an asterisk, so if you want to say 'every two hours', just use '*/2'.

The 'sixth' field (the rest of the line) specifies the command to execute.
The entire command portion of the line, up to a newline, will be executed by
the shell.

Note: The day of a command's execution can be specified by two fields 'day of
month' and 'day of week'. If both fields are restricted (i.e. aren't '*'), the
command will be executed when either field matches the current time.
For example, '30 4 1,15 * 5' would cause a command to be run at 4:30 on the
1st and 15th of each month or every friday.
If only one of the two day fields is restricted the other one (with '*') is
ignored.

Optional it is possible to define options before the first field. Each option
start with '@' and is sepearated by a blank ' '.
Available options:

    @nocatchup  If the machine wasn't on power at the specified time, the job
                won't catched up.
    @hide       Don't show the window of the job on desktop or in the taskbar.
