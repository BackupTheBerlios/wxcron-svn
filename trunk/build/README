WxCron want to support all plattforms, architectures and build environments!
Please contact me if you need support for a undescribed plattform, architecture
or build environment.

Build on Windows with MinGW and Code::Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Get the wxWidgets sources from <http://www.wxwidgets.org> and build them.
2. Download the GNU based compiler system for Windows from
   <http://www.mingw.org> and install it.
3. Download the IDE Code::Blocks from <http://www.codeblocks.org>
   and install it.
4. Setup Code::Blocks to use the installed MinGW. Take care because Code::Blocks
   comes with an own MinGW. But you shouldn't use it.
5. Open the workspace file "build/wxCron.workspace" with Code::Blocks.
6. Go to the menu "Settings/Global variables..." and set the variables
   #wx and #wxversion.
7. Then select the correct build target in the menu "Build/Select target".
   Which target you need depends on the configuration (debug, release,
   static, dynamic) you build wxWidgets.
8. Just build wxCron with the menu entry "Build/Build and run".

Build on Windows with Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Get the wxWidgets sources from <http://www.wxwidgets.org> and build them.
2. Set on Windows the environment variable WXWIN to the directory
   where wxWidgets is installed.
1. Install the IDE Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition. Different
   edition or version of that IDE should work, too.
2. Open the file "build/wxCron.sln" with the IDE.
3. Just build wxCron with the IDE.
