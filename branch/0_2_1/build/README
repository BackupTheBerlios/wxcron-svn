WxCron want to support all plattforms, architectures and build environments!
Please contact me if you need support for a undescribed plattform, architecture
or build environment.


Build on Windows with MS Visual Studio/C++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Use your installed MS Visual C++ IDE/compiler or download
   a free version here: <http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/>
2. Get the wxWidgets sources from <http://www.wxwidgets.org> and
   build ("Debug DLL" and "Release") them with MS Visual C++.
3. Set an enviromentvariable %WXWIN% to the directory where you
   saved the sources of wxWidgets.
5. Open the file "build/wxPTB.sln" with MS Visual C++ IDE.
6. Then select the correct build config ("Debug Dynamic" or "Release Static").
   Which target you need depends on the configuration you build wxWidgets with.
   
   
Build on Windows with MinGW and Code::Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Get the wxWidgets sources from <http://www.wxwidgets.org> and build them.
2. Download the GNU based compiler system for Windows from
   <http://www.mingw.org> and install it.
3. Download the IDE Code::Blocks from <http://www.codeblocks.org>
   and install it.
4. Setup Code::Blocks to use the installed MinGW. Take care because Code::Blocks
   comes with an own MinGW. But you shouldn't use it.
5. Open the workspace file "build/wxCron.workspace" with Code::Blocks.
6. Go to the menu "Settings/Global variables..." and set the variables
   #wx and #wxversion.
7. Then select the correct build target in the menu "Build/Select target".
   Which target you need depends on the configuration (debug, release,
   static, dynamic) you build wxWidgets.
8. Just build wxCron with the menu entry "Build/Build and run".
